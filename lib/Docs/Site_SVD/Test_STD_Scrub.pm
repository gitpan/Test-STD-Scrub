 Software Version Description

 for

 Test::STD::Scrub - Utilites to wild card parts of a text file for comparisons

 Revision: -

 Version: 0.01

 Date: 2003/06/19

 Prepared for: General Public 

 Prepared by:  SoftwareDiamonds.com E<lt>support@SoftwareDiamonds.comE<gt>

 Classification: NONE

=head1 1.0 SCOPE

This paragraph identifies and provides an overview
of the released files.

=head2 1.1 Indentification

This release is a collection of Perl modules that
extend the capabilities of the Perl language.

=head2 1.2 System overview

The system is the Perl programming language software.
The system does not have any hardware.
The Perl programming language contains two features that
are utilized by this release:

=over 4

=item 1

Program Modules to extend the languages

=item 2

Plain Old Documentation (POD) that may be embedded in the language

=back

These features are established by the referenced documents.

When comparing text there are small snippets such as version numbers and dates
that should be wild carded out and not influence the comparisions.
The Test::STD:Scrub module replaces these small snippets with invariant snippet.
By replacing the same part of each file with the same invariant snippet,
those small sections of text are effectively wild carded for the comparisions.

When performing tests, the ability to wild card small snippets of text is
vital in making accurate comparison. 
The same capability is also essential for version control in comparing two
pieces of software to see if there are significant changes.

Thus, the scrub methods were initially developed in support
of the 2167A  modules "Test::STDmaker" (testing) and "ExtUtils::SVDmaker"
(releasing versions) but may have uses in other modules.

The dependency of the program modules in the US DOD STD2167A bundle is as follows:
 
 File::FileUtil 
   Test::STD::Scrub
     Test::Tech
        DataPort::FileType::FormDB DataPort::DataFile Test::STD::STDutil
            Test::STDmaker ExtUtils::SVDmaker

=head2 1.3 Document overview.

This document releases Test::STD-Scrub version 0.01
providing a description of the inventory, installation
instructions and other information necessary to
utilize and track this release.

=head1 3.0 VERSION DESCRIPTION

system file specification.

Broke away the "scrub" routines from Test::TestUtil
created this module Test::STD::Scrub.

=item new methods

Added the scrub_data and scrub_probe methods

=back

=head2 3.4 Adaptation data.

This installation requires that the installation site
has the Perl programming language installed.
Installation sites running Microsoft Operating systems require
the installation of Unix utilities. 
An excellent, highly recommended Unix utilities for Microsoft
operating systems is unxutils by Karl M. Syring.
A copy is available at the following web sites:

 http://unxutils.sourceforge.net
 http://packages.SoftwareDiamnds.com

There are no other additional requirements or tailoring needed of 
configurations files, adaptation data or other software needed for this
installation particular to any installation site.

=head2 3.5 Related documents.

There are no related documents needed for the installation and
test of this release.

=head2 3.6 Installation instructions.

To installed the release file, use the CPAN module in the Perl release
or the INSTALL.PL script at the following web site:

 http://packages.SoftwareDiamonds.com

Follow the instructions for the the chosen installation software.

The distribution file is at the following respositories:

   http://www.softwarediamonds/packages/Test-STD-Scrub-0.01
   http://www.perl.com/CPAN-local/authors/id/S/SO/SOFTDIA/Test-STD-Scrub-0.01


=head2 3.6.1 Installation support.

If there are installation problems or questions with the installation
contact

 603 882-0846 E<lt>support@SoftwareDiamonds.comE<gt>

=head2 3.6.2 Installation Tests.

Most Perl installation software will run the following test script(s)
as part of the installation:

 t/Test/STD/Scrub.t

=head2 3.7 Possible problems and known errors

The Test::STD::TestUtil program module is the foundation
program module for testing
and must be rock solid to ensure the quality of
the Units that it will be testing.
Testing of this module should be proactive and
not dumped upon the end-user.

There is still much work needed to ensure the quality 
of this module as follows:

=over 4

=item *

State the functional requirements for each method 
including not only the GO paths but also what to
expect for the NOGO paths

=item *

All the tests are GO path tests. Should add
NOGO tests.

=item *

Add the requirements addressed as I<# R: >
comment to the tests

=item *

Write a program to build a matrix to trace
test step to the requirements and vice versa by
parsing the I<# R: > comments.
Automatically insert the matrix in the
Test::TestUtil POD.

=back

Note the 
L<File::FileUtil|File::FileUtil>, 
L<Test::STD::STDutil|Test::STD::STDutil> 
L<Test::STD::Scrub|Test::STD::Scrub> 
program modules breaks up 
the Test::TestUtil program module
and Test::TestUtil has disappeared.

DOCUMENT_OVERVIEW:
This document releases ${NAME} version ${VERSION}
providing a description of the inventory, installation
instructions and other information necessary to
utilize and track this release.
^

CAPABILITIES:
When comparing text there are small snippets such as version numbers and dates
that should be wild carded out and not influence the comparisions.
The Test::STD:Scrub module replaces these small snippets with invariant snippet.
By replacing the same part of each file with the same invariant snippet,
those small sections of text are effectively wild carded for the comparisions.

When performing tests, the ability to wild card small snippets of text is
vital in making accurate comparison. 
The same capability is also essential for version control in comparing two
pieces of software to see if there are significant changes.

Thus, the scrub methods were initially developed in support
of the 2167A  modules "Test::STDmaker" (testing) and "ExtUtils::SVDmaker"
(releasing versions) but may have uses in other modules.

The dependency of the program modules in the US DOD STD2167A bundle is as follows:
 
 File::FileUtil 
   Test::STD::Scrub
     Test::Tech
        DataPort::FileType::FormDB DataPort::DataFile Test::STD::STDutil
            Test::STDmaker ExtUtils::SVDmaker
